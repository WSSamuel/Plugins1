Delete Old Posts and Pictures

== Description ==
If you're a regular user of WordPress, you know how important it is to keep your website up-to-date with fresh content and images. 
But what happens to your old posts and pictures that are no longer relevant or useful?
They just sit there, taking up valuable space on your server and slowing down your website. This is where the Delete Old Posts and Pictures plugin comes in.
The Delete Old Posts and Pictures plugin is a powerful tool that allows you to easily delete old posts and pictures from your WordPress website. 
With just a few clicks, you can free up space on your server, improve your website's speed and performance, and keep your content fresh and relevant.
Using the Delete Old Posts and Pictures plugin is simple. Once you install the plugin, it will set up a menu in your WordPress admin page. 
From there, you can choose how many months old you want your posts and pictures to be before they are deleted. 
The plugin allows you to select a custom date range, or you can use the default option of 6 months old.
Once you've selected your date range, you'll see two buttons: "Delete Old Posts" and "Delete Old Pictures". 
Simply click on the button you want, and the plugin will automatically remove all posts or pictures that are older than the specified time frame.
One of the great things about the Delete Old Posts and Pictures plugin is that it allows you to delete posts and pictures separately.
