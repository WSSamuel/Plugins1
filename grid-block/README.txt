Grid Block is a new grid creation plugin for WordPress. Based on the 12 column grid system. Allows responsive controls of the columns.

== Description ==
[Grid Block](https://digitalapps.co/wordpress-plugins/grid-block/) is a new grid creation plugin for WordPress. Grid block plugin adds a new block for the Gutenberg editor. The idea was to create something very simple as an alternative to the default Columns block.

We wanted to keep this block light-weight. We use this plugin inhouse as a corner stone for building websites for our clients. This is a no bloat, no extras, no overheads plugin, all you get is a grid block for your editor.

This plugin would suit a developer who needs the basic grid system to build a custom theme and other blocks.

Based on the 12 column grid system. Allows responsive controls of the columns.

Grid block requires only a tiny css file on the frontend to run, no JavaScript. Grid block has been tested with Autoptimize caching plugin. The css file for the grid block is easily bundled by autoptimize.

If you have suggestions for the grid block plugin, please let me know. I have recently added horizontal alignment for the block columns. In the next update I'm planning to add background color/image controls for the grid block and for the column block.
