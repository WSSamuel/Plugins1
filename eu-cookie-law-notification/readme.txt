This plugin displays a notification asking the first time visitor for consent to use cookies on the site

== Description ==

The Cookie Law is now in effect across the EU and websites are required to obtain consent to use cookies from visitors.

Using an implied consent method, this plugin displays a notification asking the first time visitor for consent to use cookies on the site.
<a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/news/blog/2012/updated-ico-advice-guidance-e-privacy-directive-eu-cookie-law">Please visit here for more information on EU cookie law and guidance</a>

The notification appears if a particular cookie doesnâ€™t exist and it disappears if either the visitor clicks accept(text customisable), or keeps browsing the site.

Most elements in this plugin are customisable from the setting page, including:

* Notification text
* Accept button text
* Link text to a detail page, which is created on first activation
* Able to choose the detail page - initially chooses the page it created on activation
* Width of the notification in pixel or percentage
* Position of the notification
* Opacity of the background of the notification

Please update the detail page appropriately with information on the cookies being used on your site.

Although this plugin follows the best common practice, please note that each European country applies different guidance and law and the site administrator using this plugin is responsible for complying with the law.

This plugin could also be used for any other purpose to notify visitors of a message.
