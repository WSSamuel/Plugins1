Enable the new WordPress block editor for Easy Digital Downloads products.

== Description ==

This plugin enables the new WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor for the Downloads post type from Easy Digital Downloads any other plugin or theme that uses a custom post type with the `download` slug.

Note: This plugin does _not_ extend the Block Editor. If you are looking for a Downloads block to use on other pages or post, see [Easy Digital Downloads â€“ Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/edd-blocks/).

Although EDD and all its extensions are [not yet guaranteed to be compatible](https://docs.easydigitaldownloads.com/article/2086-wordpress-5-gutenberg-compatibility) with the new editor, testing with the following plugins has _not revealed_ any issues so far:

* Easy Digital Downloads
* EDD Software Licensing
* EDD External Products
* EDD Invoices
* EDD Manual Purchases
* EDD Recurring Payments
* EDD Sales Recovery
* EDD Stripe Payment Gateway

**Know incompatibilities**

* EDD Cross-sell and Upsell

If you find any incompatibilities, please let me know on the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/edd-block-editor).

Likewise, let me know if you find this plugin to be compatible with a plugin not mentioned here, so I can update the known list :)
