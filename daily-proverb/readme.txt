Display a Daily Proverb in your language.

== Description ==

This plugin displays a daily proverb from the book of Proverbs. The daily verses are preset, however, in the admin panel there are options to set your preferred verse for the day.

Also, good news! The book of Proverbs comes pre-installed in 25+ languages. For faster loading, there are no external API calls or any other external credentials needed. Just install the plugin, select your language, insert the shortcode in a post or page, and watch as the verse change daily. 

Please note! For this to work properly, you should have your WordPress timezone setting set to your current timezone.
